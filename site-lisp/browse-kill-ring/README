ABOUT

Are you tired of using the endless keystrokes of 'C-y M-y M-y M-y ...' to get
at that bit of text you killed thirty-seven kills ago? Ever wish you could just
look through everything you've killed recently to find out if you killed that
piece of text that you think you killed, but you're not quite sure? If so, then
browse-kill-ring.el is the emacs extension for you.
Originally written by Colin Walters (Debian Developer, Emacs hacker, SELinux
hacker, and general Free Software Guru Extrordinaire), I am the new maintainer
of browse-kill-ring.el.

INSTALLATION

Installation is simple. First, put browse-kill-ring.el somewhere in your emacs
'load-path'. Next, add the form (require 'browse-kill-ring) to your ~/.emacs
file. Optionally, you can make it so all you need to do is type M-y to use
browse-kill-ring by adding the form (browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings) to
your ~/.emacs, or another key of your choice by using the form
(global-set-key (kbd "key combination") 'browse-kill-ring). Simple, no?
